#   The solution is based on the existence of a functional relation between the spiral coordinate iInput and the
# circle "radius" r (the circle "radius" takes the circle number idCircle for every first element of the circle)
#
#  The number of elements of each spiral can be calculated from elements of the inner adjacent spiral by
# (1) nElem(idCircle) = nElem(idCircle-1) + 8 valid for all i in (1,infinity)
#
# Recursively using eq. (1) with nElem(1) = 8 leads to
# (2) nElem(idCircle) = idCircle * 8
#
# e.g.  nElem(1) = 8
#       nElem(2) = 16
#       nElem(3) = 24
#
# The total number of elements including the idCircle-th circle is given by the algorithm
#
# (3) nElemAll(idCircle)    = nElem(idCircle) + nElem(idCircle-1) + ... + nElem(2) + nElem(1) + 1
#                           = 1 + SUM { nElem(i) } with i from 1 to nCircle
# which can also be expressed using (2) as
# (4) nElemAll(idCircle)    = 1 + SUM {idCircle * 8} with i from 1 to idCircle
#                           = 1 + 8 * SUM {idCircle} with i from 1 to idCircle.
#
# Now the sum can be identified as the algorithmic relation of the arithmetic series for which the functional relation
#
# (5) SUM {idCircle} with i from 1 to idCircle = idCircle * (idCircle + 1) / 2
# which leads to
#
# (6) nElemAll(idCircle)    = 1 + 8 * idCircle * (idCircle + 1) / 2
#
# Because the functional relation of the arithmetic series is only of second power, the reverse function exists as the
# solution of the quadratic equation
#
# (7) 0    = (nCircle ** 2) + 1 * nCircle + (1 - nElemAll) * (2 / 8)
#                            \_/            \______________________/
#                             p                         q
#
# with the solution
#
# (8) nCircle = -p/2 +- sqrt(p**2 / 2 - q)
#
# considering that for ifCircle > 1, q < 1/2 and hence (p**2 / 2 - q) > 0, only the positive squares
#
# (9) nCircle = -p/2 + sqrt(p**2 / 2 - q)
#
# are considered. Because (6) is monotonous rising function, even if nElemAll is between two circles, (9) leads to
# nCircle between two that of two circles. Therefore, the circle number is finally evaluated from input number by
#
# (10) nCircle = floor (eq.(9) (iInput -> nElemAll)). ! Don't forget to consider rounding errors close to nElemAll
#
# With (3) and (6), the number of all elements including this circle as well as the number of elements in this circle
# can be evaluated and therefore the "angle" of the element, from which by application of modulus, the
# Manhatten-distance can be evaluated.
#
# The approach is very efficient for large spiral coordinates, because it doesn't require loops and the
# number of operations is therefore independent of the coordinate or spiral radius.
